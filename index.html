    <p>
					I'm Daniel  Martin, a multidisciplinary designer living in 
					Minneapolis. I recently graduated from theMaster of Fine Arts program in Graphic Design
					at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Prior to moving to Minnesota, I received an M.S. in  				Technical Communication and Information Architecture at Illinois Institute of Technologyâ€¦ and 
					that's when I fell in love with design.
				</p>
	 
				<p>
					I'm interested in graphic design and graphic design education, editorial design and the design of
					scholarship, creativity studies, digital humanities, graphic design and art history, and digital fabrication. 
					I've led design studio courses, curated an exhibition about creativity, produced academic journals for 
					print and electronic publication, and conducted creative research into the visual nature of modern publications. 
					
				<p>
					Before graduate school I worked forThe University of Chicago Press
					Journals Division in a production role, handling the typesetting, art, proofing, printing, and posting of a
					host of academic journals in both physical and electronic forms. I have extensive experience in writing, editing, and
					proofreading; my design practice is influenced by these fields in its initial, iterative phases, akin to working on a written outline and draft,
					as well as the latter phases of a project where critique mimics careful editing and precise revision of prose.
					
					Cooking for my wife, playing with my dog String Bean, riding my bike, listening to music and watching soccer are a few of my
					non-design pastimes.
